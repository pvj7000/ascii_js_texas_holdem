<h2>ASCII Texas Hold'em &mdash; code tour</h2>
<p>Browser-based heads-up Texas Hold'em where you face four AI personas. Each hand follows standard blinds ($10/$20), hole cards, flop/turn/river, and a showdown that respects all-in side pots. Controls map to live play: Fold, Check/Call (auto-labeled with the price to continue), Bet/Raise to a chosen amount, advance to the next hand, or restart after busting.</p>
<h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entrypoint wiring:</strong> <code>assets/js/main.js</code> seeds five <code>Player</code> instances (four AI, one human), constructs the UI, logs the session intro, and runs an async loop that hands control to <code>playHand</code>. On bust, stacks reset and the loop restarts.</li>
  <li><strong>State + table model:</strong> <code>createGameState</code> tracks blinds, dealer/button position, deck, board/burn piles, betting caps, and exposes a <code>pot()</code> helper so UI and logic share the same snapshot.</li>
  <li><strong>Deck + cards:</strong> <code>Deck</code> builds a 52-card list of immutable <code>Card</code> objects, then shuffles with a Fisher&ndash;Yates loop powered by <code>crypto.getRandomValues</code> to keep permutations unbiased.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand lifecycle:</strong> <code>playHand</code> resets per-street bets, shuffles/deals in live order, posts blinds, runs four betting rounds via <code>bettingRound</code>, burns/turns community cards between streets, and triggers <code>showdown</code> when needed. Dealer rotation skips busted seats.</li>
  <li><strong>Betting engine:</strong> <code>bettingRound</code> builds a turn queue, restarts action after raises, and ends early when only one contender remains. Action helpers (<code>actFold</code>, <code>actCall</code>, <code>actRaiseTo</code>) mutate stacks, enforce minimum raises, and log verbs that mimic real table talk.</li>
  <li><strong>AI personas:</strong> <code>aiAction</code> evaluates hand strength with preflop heuristics and a 7-card evaluator, then blends aggression/looseness/bluff sliders per persona (Rock, Maniac, Station, Pro). Position and pot odds gate whether to fold, call, or size a raise; maniacs occasionally over-shove strong holdings.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand evaluator + side pots:</strong> The evaluator scores 5- and 7-card hands with straight/flush edge cases and compares tuple keys for ranking. <code>showdown</code> builds main/side pots from each player&rsquo;s total contributions, awards chips per pot to the best eligible hand, and rounds splits cleanly.</li>
  <li><strong>ASCII-first UI:</strong> <code>createUI</code> renders the table as styled text inside a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, wrapping HUD rows, community board, and seats into ASCII dividers. Controls emit Promises so the async game flow reads procedurally; card tokens are colorized via <code>innerHTML</code> after suit-aware escaping. Log entries prepend so the newest move stays on top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because everything is plain ES modules and DOM APIs, the project is view-source friendly: open <code>index.html</code> and the game boots instantly without builds or dependencies.</p>
